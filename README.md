# Reporting Service

:eu: *"This service was created in the context of OpenAgri project (https://horizon-openagri.eu/). OpenAgri has received funding from the EU’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no. 101134083."*
# Description

The reporting service generates .pdf reports based on information present in datasets.\
These datasets are required to conform to the OCSM (OpenAgri Common Semantic Model) as well as be JSON-LD compliant.

# Roadmap

High-level next steps for the Reporting Service:

- [ ] Implement PDF reports for irrigation fertilization
- [ ] Integrate with additional 3rd party Open Street Maps API for satelite images
- [ ] Update PDF reports design and tables to be more adaptive for different use cases
 
# Requirements
<ul>
    <li>git</li>
    <li>docker</li>
    <li>docker-compose</li>
</ul>

Docker version used during development: 27.0.3

# Installation

There are two ways to install this service, via docker or directly from source.

<h3> Deploying from source </h3>

When deploying from source, use python 3:12.\
Also, you should use a [venv](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/) when doing this.

A list of libraries that are required for this service is present in the "requirements.txt" file.\
This service uses FastAPI as a web framework to serve APIs, alembic for database migrations, fpdf2 for\
.pdf generation, sqlalchemy for database ORM mapping and pytest for testing purposes.

<h3> Pre commit hook </h3>

When working with repo after "requirements.txt" is installed \
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt (inside activated venv)
```
run:
```shell
pre-commit install
```

When pre-commit enabled and installed, after every commit ruff and black formatters \
will be activated to resolve formatting of python files.
<h3> Deploying via docker </h3>

After installing <code> docker </code> you can run the following commands to run the application:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

The application will be served on http://127.0.0.1:8009 (I.E. typing localhost/docs in your browser will load the swagger documentation)

The Animal Report API can be used with or without Gatekeeper support:

With Gatekeeper: The data file parameter can be ignored.
Without Gatekeeper: Data must be provided in JSON file format.
If no data file is provided and Gatekeeper is not enabled, the API fetches data from an external Farm Calendar service. The request is made with the provided filters, and the system retrieves the necessary animal data.

If a valid JSON file is uploaded, the API processes the data directly to generate the report

<h2>Pytest</h2>
Pytest can be run on the same machine the service has been deployed to by moving into the app dir and running:

```
pytest
```

This will run all tests and return success values for each api tested in the terminal.

<h3>These tests will NOT result in generated .pdf files.</h3>

## Working examples
